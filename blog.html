<p><em>26 June 2024</em></p>

<p>I began playing drums when I was 14, but 2009-10 was the last time I toured and recorded. I’m finally back at it, goofing around on electronic and acoustic kits. I’m slowly learning guitar as well. I’ve been taking lessons with UVic Music grad, Matt Graumans, since February 2023. I’m fairly confident I wouldn’t have finished grad school without music in my life, and now guitar is pushing my brain and body to stay creative.</p>

<p><em>9 May 2024</em></p>

<p>I took a minute earlier this week to populate my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7181-1703">Open Researcher and Contributor ID record</a>. I created some entries manually; however, many of them were generated automatically by BASE, Scopus, Crossref Metadata, The Lens, MLA’s international bib, and the like. The automatically generated data is nowhere near perfect. I encountered numerous errors, but I suppose those hiccups are the trade-off for efficiency and ease of use. I’ll be interested to observe the benefits and drawbacks of using ORCID over a period of five or so years. More from me in 2030?</p>

<p>Yesterday, I gave a keynote at <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/english/about/events/reimagining-the-victorians-conference">“Re-Imagining the Victorians,”</a> facilitated by Brooke Cameron and Sydney Wildman at Queen’s University. My talk drew material from my current book project. I called it, <a href="archive/talks/queens24/">“Victorian Activities and the Play of Genre in Video Games.”</a> After surveying what the Victorian period teaches us about games today, I focused on two neo-Victorian games: <em>80 Days</em> and <em>Strange Horticulture</em>. The Q&amp;A was fantastic, as were other talks at the conference. Peruse the <a href="archive/talks/queens24/reImaginingTheVictorians2024.pdf">program</a> if you’ve a moment. Many thanks to Brooke and Sydney for hosting me. I look forward to more discussions at the intersections of Victorian Studies and Game Studies.</p>

<h1 id="congrats-to-margaret-kilcline-and-odu"><a href="#congrats-to-margaret-kilcline-and-odu">Congrats to Margaret Kilcline and ODU</a></h1>

<p><em>12 March 2024</em></p>

<p>Here’s some wonderful <a href="https://www.odu.edu/al/article/creative-ideas-sprout-and-thrive-inside-mpark">news from ODU</a>: “It’s compact in size, but there’s nothing small about the ambitions behind a new, humanities-focused makerspace at Old Dominion University. Called mpark, it opened late 2023 in Room 2027 of the university’s Batten Arts and Letters Building. Outfitted with a 3D printer, Arduino electronics learning kits, sewing machines, video recorders, cameras, printers and other tools and software, it functions as a miniature makerspace ‘that nurtures nonhierarchical collaborations across disciplines,’ wrote Margaret Kilcline/Konkol, an assistant professor of American literature and digital humanities and director of the new workshop.”</p>

<p>Margaret adds: “I got my first taste of the magic of makerspaces at University of Victoria’s Digital Humanities Summer Institute. Jentery Sayers and Matt Huculak and others were at the center of an exciting makerspace movement in the UVic English Department and over the course of a one-week intensive workshop (I call it nerd camp at its finest), they introduced me and about 15 other souls to modeling and prototyping using SketchUp, AutoCAD, Arduinos, and laser cutters.”</p>

<p>Thanks for the nod, Margaret. Everyone here at the <a href="/praxis">Praxis Studio</a> is pulling for you and mpark.</p>

<p><em>5 February 2024</em></p>

<p>I had a lively conversation with Leia Soulsbury and Braedon Lowey on the <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/uvic-esa"><em>Clearihue Corner</em></a> podcast produced by UVic’s English Students’ Association. We talked about games and interactive fiction from a literary perspective, and we wandered into other topics as well: from play, labor, romance, and the economy of games to issues of representation, self-expression, adaptation, design, and narration. The conversation is Episode 5 in Season 4 of the <em>Clearihue Corner</em>, and it’s titled <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/uvic-esa/episodes/S4E05--Interactive-Fiction-is-All-Fun-and-Games-Office-Hours-with-Dr--Jentery-Sayers-e2f5hno">“Interactive Fiction Is All Fun and Games.”</a> Thanks so much, Leia and Braedon, for the invitation and taking the time to speak with me. I was chatty! Also, your description of the episode makes me smile:</p>

<p>“You are scrolling through Spotify and stop at a podcast called the Clearihue Corner. <br />
&gt;Investigate<br />
This episode features a professor named Jentery Sayers, and seems to be about fiction in interactive forms: twine games, video games, choose your own adventure novels, and more. It features in depth discussion about how to analyze and talk about these kinds of narratives. Would you like to listen? <br />
&gt;Yes <br />
You press play, and the podcast begins.”</p>

I titled it, <a href="archive/talks/tamu/">“Degrowing Digital Projects.”</a> CoDHR made a neat <a href="archive/talks/tamu/degrowing.png">poster</a> for the event, and here’s my abstract:</p>

<p>“While digital projects in the humanities are frequently associated with innovation, less attention may be paid to their care and maintenance over time. This talk draws from recent research in activity theory and minimal computing as well as allied fields, such as game studies, to address the ‘degrowth’ of digital projects from the labor perspective. First, I outline the motives and trajectories of this perspective, and then I communicate the importance of value-sensitive design to determining three things: 1) a project’s needs and desires, 2) what work is required and from whom, and 3) how to sustain the labor involved. Degrowth aims to reduce computation’s alienating effects in the interests of social organization and collective expertise, and it does so by foregrounding the cultures and habits of digital projects over their technical particulars. These issues matter for the livelihood of practitioners as gig economics and precarious labor become the norm in the technology sector.”</p>

<p>Many thanks to Maura Ives, Bryan Tarpley, Kayley Hart, and everyone in Texas A&amp;M’s digital humanities working group for hosting me. It was a fabulous time.</p>

Here are my <a href="archive/talks/connectu/">slides</a>. They include a rationale for the course as well as some photographs of games that students prototyped. During the talk, I explained how and why “Paper Computers” encouraged students to develop procedural literacy, experiment with low-tech methods, engage histories and cultures of media, understand contexts of play and use, design critically, and connect with communities of practice. I then articulated these six areas with the notion of prototyping the past: in this case, making games informed by literary and political movements from the 19th and 20th centuries. Thanks to UVic for inviting me to speak at this event, and to David Leach for joining me.</p>

<p><em>26 February 2019</em></p>

<p>Today, I gave a talk during an NEH ODH Institute on “Textual Data and Digital Texts in the Undergraduate Classroom,” directed by Lauren Coats and Emily McGinn. I titled it, <a href="archive/talks/neh">“Low-Tech Approaches to Digital Research,”</a> with a focus on two questions: how to approach digital research in the classroom without assuming technical competencies in computing, and how to teach important techniques often automated or masked by tools and software. I responded to both by providing examples of low-tech prototyping as inquiry. They included the use of Markdown for web development, graphical overlays for data visualization, paper manuals for game design, cardboard models for media history, wireframes for conjectural criticism, remediations for archival work, and zines for science and technology studies. Thanks to Lauren and Emily for inviting me to participate in this timely institute, which resulted in a compelling collection of open access materials: <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:28413/"><em>Digital Texts and Textual Data: A Pedagogical Anthology</em></a>.</p>

<h1 id="tabletop-inquiry"><a href="#tabletop-inquiry">Tabletop Inquiry</a></h1>

<p><em>5 December 2018</em></p>

<p>I wrote a reflection on my <a href="/papercomputers/">“Paper Computers”</a> seminar. It’s intended for graduate students in the course; however, I hope it’s of use to other people, including those who are interested in media studies. It’s titled <a href="/tabletop/">“Tabletop Inquiry”</a> and consists of three point-form lists. The <a href="/tabletop/#observations">first</a> is a series of observations made while studying and prototyping paper computers this semester; it’s meant to document and distill some of our seminar conversations. The <a href="/tabletop/#prompts-for-project-design">second list</a> outlines some questions prompted by tabletop prototyping for project design in the humanities; it’s meant to highlight how tabletop prototyping may apply to a broader set of research practices (not just to games). The <a href="/tabletop/#types-of-prototypes">third list</a> itemizes types of prototypes for engaging history; it’s meant to provide a working vocabulary for prototyping as a form of criticism. Thanks again to Avery Alder, Nina Belojevic, Whitney “Strix” Beltrán, Anne Burdick, Emily Care Boss, Alexander Galloway, Amy Hildreth Chen, Isaac Childres, Derek Hansen, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Kari Kraus, Michael Lines, Shaun Macpherson, Renee M. Shelby, Nikki Valens, and Lara Wilson for contributing to the seminar as guest speakers. It was a joy to teach.</p>

<p><em>4 December 2018</em></p>

<p>I developed a resource titled <a href="/typesofprototypes/">“Types of Prototypes”</a> for people who are curious about how prototyping or “remaking” source materials intersects with the praxis of literary and textual criticism. It lists seven types of prototypes and explains what they help us to better understand. Then it describes how prototyping may be a form of criticism. It concludes by explaining how prototypes “address us.” Inspired by Kari Kraus’s research, I’m using this framework for a few ongoing projects.</p>

Echoing Olin’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180702040445/https://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/">website</a>, Sketch Model is “a set of experimental approaches that embody the exploratory spirit of ideas-under-construction inherent in sketch models for prototyping: imagining the creative contours and operations for an expanded practice of engineering that includes the robust expressive criticality of the arts, history, and culture.” Many thanks to Sara Hendren (PI), Ben Linder (PI), Debbie Chachra, and Jonathan Adler for hosting me. I gained an incredible amount of knowledge about prototyping across the disciplines (from industry and engineering to design and the humanities), and Sara and Ben did an absolutely brilliant job of bringing together a group of invested practitioners.</p>

<p><em>11 May 2018</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, I gave a talk at the University of Puget Sound titled, “Starting in the Middle,” where I outlined eight pedagogical approaches to critical media practice: 1) negotiating We/I/Them/It with Text/Context, 2) the participatory observer (who is not “detached”), 3) boundary-making in design (contrasted with appeals to abstract functions and ideal features), 4) matters of contingency and interface (as distinct from evidence or proof), 5) the entanglements of language with materials, 6) iteration as inquiry (working with machines, not delegating tasks to them), 7) multimodal composition (rather than digitization as re-presentation), and 8) accounting for shadow pasts and futures (not only certainties). Thanks to Jane Carlin and Collins Memorial Library for inviting me, and to Jamie L. Spaine for coordinating my visit.

<p>The University of Washington’s Department of English invited me to speak at the Simpson Center for the Humanities on the topic of designing digital studies courses for graduate students. I presented some possible three-course sequences for UW English, and I also created a resource based on the talk. It’s titled, <a href="/designingcourses/">“Locating Praxis in Digital Studies”</a>.

I engaged six particular angles on design during my portion of the discussion: design 1) as an attribution practice, 2) as inquiry, 3) for experience, 4) for responsibility, 5) in-use, and 6) for diffraction. With material from the talk, I produced a resource titled, <a href="/criticaldesign">“Critical Design,”</a> which briefly describes each of these angles and their motivations.

Many thanks to Patrick Berry, Collin Brooke, Patrick Williams, and Jason Markins for hosting me, and to Jenny Doctor for giving me a tour of the Belfer Lab and Archive. Here’s my abstract for the “Prototyping as Composition” talk:</p>

<p>“Across the humanities, art, design, engineering, as well as numerous memory institutions, researchers are giving digital fabrication techniques such as 3-D printing significant attention. In response, this talk examines the affordances of fabrication for scholarly communication, with particular attention to rapid prototyping, or the iterative production of abstract models in tactile form, as a compositional strategy. Against the grain of the techno-evangelism and hype often witnessed in maker cultures, I outline the relationships between writing academic essays and producing tactile objects with computer numerical control (CNC) machines such as laser cutters, millers, spindles, and printers. Instead of suggesting that writing is somehow secondary to the primary experience of making things, I underscore how prototyping is intricately entangled with archival research and the writing that emerges through that research.”</p>

Many thanks to Tim Murray for inviting and hosting me. It was beyond humbling to be in the <a href="https://societyhumanities.as.cornell.edu/ad-white-house">A.D. White House</a> to discuss my research with scholars there. Here’s my abstract for the talk:</p>

<p>“When conducting archival research, historians of media and technology frequently encounter devices that no longer work or existed only as illustrations, fictions, or one-offs. Rather than studying such uncertainty at a remove, this talk outlines ways to prototype absences in the historical record. It draws from examples of remaking old media to demonstrate how prototyping the past affords unique approaches to examining the contingent relations between matter and meaning, without fetishizing exact reproductions of historical artifacts.”</p>

<p>My inimitable colleague, Shamma Boyarin, kindly invited me to speak yesterday in his “Heavy Metal Subcultures” course. I had such an amazing time and cannot thank him enough. I seized the opportunity to share something near and dear to me: my experiences in the Richmond, Virginia punk scene. Given the course theme, I addressed how RVA punk overlapped with metal in various ways. I showed photographs I took of bands such as Neurosis, Thrones, and Avail  during the late ’90s, and I played music by Inquisition, Action Patrol, Hose.Got.Cable, Spitboy, Born Against, Ipecac, Eucharist, Black Emanuelle, Orlock, and Four Walls Falling, all with photos, too.

<p><em>25 February 2015</em></p>

<p>Two weeks ago, I visited the University of South Carolina to conduct a workshop on prototyping the past. I also gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310055846/http://sc.edu/about/centers/digital_humanities/future_knowledge_archive/sayers_videopage.php">“Future Knowledge” talk</a> on the <a href="archive/talks/southcarolina/">“digging condition”</a> or “material turn” in digital humanities. The digging condition is a scenario where materiality wins in the last instance; it’s when we think about data, software, hardware, and platforms as matter all the way down. Responding to this tendency, my talk underscored not only how media are constructed but also why media history is the most engaging when we don’t know, cannot recover, or must speculate about something. How, in short, do new media materialize in the first place, and what happens to historical inquiry as those materials morph, degrade, and disappear?

<p><em>12 September 2014</em></p>

<p>Back in April, Nina Belojevic, Shaun Macpherson, Kaitlynn McQueston, and I traveled to the Ministry of Culture in Lima, where we set up a popup makerspace for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121345/http://hastac2014.org/">HASTAC 2014</a>. Nina <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/lima2/">describes</a> the makerspace’s theme like so: “The admittedly experimental theme of the popup makerspace was, ‘Whose Hand Am I Holding Anyway?’ We used the space’s temporary infrastructure to draw public attention to the intricate relationships between bodies, data, immediacy, and distance in a ‘global’ digital economy. We first cast hands in plaster and then—with anyone who stumbled upon the space—created silicon proxies of those hands. The proxies were embedded with sensors, and later in the conference we wrote an Arduino sketch to not only log when the sensors were triggered but also display messages via a serial readout. Conference participants could shake hands with these rather defamiliarizing proxies, an often amusing encounter that was immediately confirmed on a screen in the space. The handshake data was then logged so that we’d know, by the conference’s conclusion, how many people the proxies had ‘met.’”</p>

Sherry Tross (Executive Secretary for Integral Development, Organization of American States), Luis Jaime Castillo Butters (Vice Minister for Cultural Heritage and Cultural Industries, Peru), Mitchell Baker (Chairperson, Mozilla Foundation), Connie Yowell (Education Director, MacArthur Foundation), José-Carlos Mariátegui (Founder of Andean High Technology; Co‐Founder and Director of Escuelab), and Maryse Robert (Director, Department of Economic and Social Development, Organization of American States) gave keynotes at the conference; the OAS published a <a href="https://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-161/14">press release</a> for it; and, on Friday, April 25th, Nina and I presented our research on <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/lima/">“Making a Kit for Cultural History.”</a> Thanks to Tim Murray at Cornell for presenting alongside us and to SSHRC for supporting the MLab’s trip to Lima.</p>

Opened in 2012, the Maker Lab follows the recent trend of ‘makerspaces’ – collaborative, community-based workshops stocked with tools and materials for people to experiment with and create new things. But, what sets the UVic lab apart is blending this ‘makerspace ethos’ with the humanities.”</p>

Thanks to the inimitable Arienne Dwyer and Brian Rosenblum for inviting me. “Return to the Material” was a brilliant, timely, and engaging event. I hope we see more like it.</p>

<p><em>3 August 2013</em></p>

<p>This weekend, I was a plenary speaker at the <a href="https://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/2013/07/10/ubc-hosts-editing-modernism-on-and-off-the-page-summer-institute/">“Editing Modernism On and Off the Page”</a> institute on UBC’s beautiful Okanagan campus. My talk was about <a href="archive/talks/temic2013/">“Editing, Annotating, and Discovering Historical Audio.”</a> I drew heavily from material in my dissertation, and after the talk I was fortunate to hear George Bowering, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, Fred Wah, and Sharon Thesen each read their own work. Many thanks to Karis Shearer for inviting me to UBCO.</p>

<p><em>22 July 2013</em></p>

<p>The annual Digital Humanities conference was at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this summer. Jeremy Boggs, Devon Elliot, and I conducted a <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/workshops-009.html">workshop</a> on desktop fabrication and then gave a <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-441.html">talk</a> on the same topic, both around the theme of moving from 2D to 3D in humanities research. We published our <a href="archive/talks/dh2013/madetomake/">slides</a>, and our <a href="archive/talks/dh2013/">notes</a> contain what we hope will be a useful bibliography for anyone with interests in fabrication, physical computing, and the humanities. Thank you, Jeremy and Devon, for collaborating with me on this work.</p>

<p><em>15 June 2013</em></p>

<p>I visited Vancouver Island University on May 29th to give a talk titled, <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/popups/">“Portable, Tacit, Temporary: Popup Makerspaces in the Humanities.”</a> Central to my argument was the claim that popups can be possibility spaces rather than demonstration spaces, and near the end of my presentation I highlighted why we must attend to infrastructure in the humanities. Many thanks to the VIU@Cowichan Innovation Lab, the Humanities Interdisciplinarity Research Group, Sally Carpentier, and Richard J. Lane for organizing the event and inviting me.</p>

It took me a few months to design, build, and populate, but I hope the results are worth the time and effort. The site already contains over 40 posts by our team of eleven people, and thanks to artist, Grace Yang, the MLab even has a <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/mLabLogoFull.png">logo</a>.</p>

<p>We will do our best to share our research, including our <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/croc/">Crocodile Café exhibit</a> as well as our <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/mod/">collaborations with the MVP</a>, as it all unfolds. We are also considering what it means for a humanities lab to function as a <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/">makerspace</a>. What <em>is</em> a humanities makerspace, and under what cultural assumptions might it operate?</p>

<p><em>6 September 2012</em></p>

<p>I received an internal research grant from UVic to start the “Allied Audio Archives” project. The aim of the project is to collocate audio from institutions and communities across the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and produce online exhibits that showcase and historicize regional audio cultures. I’m using the internal funding to support a graduate research assistant (Shaun Macpherson) in designing and developing our first exhibit, which will contextualize the University of Washington’s <a href="https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/croc">Crocodile Café Collection</a> with interviews, ephemera, local history, and cultural criticism.</p>

<p>Many thanks to John Vallier at UW for helping me to facilitate this project, which began in 2010-11 when I was teaching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150403221145/http://www.jenteryteaches.com/343/">Media and Communication Studies</a> at UW Bothell.</p>

<p><em>26 July 2012</em></p>

<p>I’ve been thinking through the theme of “Writing with Sound” for about a year now, and this month I gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224194437/https://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/writing-with-sound-composing-multimodal-long-form-scholarship/">talk</a> on the topic at the University of Hamburg during the 2012 Digital Humanities conference. It was <a href="https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/13920">recorded</a>, and one question I considered is how critics might compose responsive content for audiences who are reading, watching, <em>and</em> listening to their material.</p>

<p>The talk drew heavily from my work on the Scalar platform as well as a <a href="http://mediacommons.org/tne/pieces/writing-sound">piece</a> I published over at <em>The New Everyday</em> as part of Kari Kraus’s wonderful collection, <a href="http://mediacommons.org/tne/cluster/rough-cuts-media-and-design-process">“Rough Cuts: Media and Design in Process,”</a> which features work by Katharine Beutner, Elizabeth Bonsignore, Nicholas Chen, Christy Dena, Rachel Donahue, Ken Eklund, Jason Farman, Ann Fraistat, Oliver Gaycken, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Henry Lowood, Nick Montfort, Rick Prelinger, Ernesto Priego, Rita Raley, Gabriela Redwine, Marc Ruppel, Mark Sample, Rita Shewbridge, Amanda Visconti, Greg Walsh, and Joshua Weiner.

<p>Congratulations to my colleague, Stephen Ross, who is the principal investigator of the <a href="https://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/">Modernist Versions Project</a>, which received a SSHRC Partnership Development Grant for three years. I’m excited to contribute to the MVP. It aims to advance the potential for comparative interpretations of modernist texts that exist in multiple forms by digitizing, collating, versioning, and visualizing them individually and in combination. Its primary mission is to enable new critical insights that are difficult without digital or computational approaches.

<p>“This session features innovative advanced doctoral students and junior scholars who are making their mark as scholars and as teachers using new interactive, multimedia technologies of writing and publishing in their research and classrooms. The panelists cross the boundaries of the humanities, arts, sciences, and technology and are committed to new forms of scholarship and pedogogy. They practice the virtues of open, public, digitally accessible thinking and represent the vibrancy of our profession.

<p><em>1 July 2011</em></p>

<p>I am honored to receive the University of Washington’s 2011 College of Arts and Sciences Graduate Medal in the Humanities. According to the College’s newsletter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094332/https://www.artsci.washington.edu/newsletter/June11/DeansMedalists.asp"><em>Perspectives</em></a>, “[e]ach year, the College of Arts and Sciences presents the Dean’s Medal to four exceptional graduating seniors, representing the College’s four divisions — arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Now the College is celebrating its graduate students as well, with the introduction of an annual Graduate Medal, also with one recipient per division. ‘These annual medals are an opportunity to shine a spotlight on some of our very best students,’ says Ana Mari Cauce, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. ‘Our graduate students deserve to share in that spotlight. With so many remarkable students, the challenge is to limit our selection to one undergraduate and one graduate student from each of our divisions.’”</p>

<p>Many thanks to the College and Dean Cauce for their work, their support, and this kind gesture. Congratulations as well to the other inaugural graduate medalists: Heather Raikes (Arts), Juned Shaikh (Social Sciences), and Aurelia Honerkamp-Smith (Natural Sciences). Such stellar company!</p>
